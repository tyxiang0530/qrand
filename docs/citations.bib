    abstract = "{Coincidence counting is a necessary ingredient for quantum optics experiments at the undergraduate level, but cost has created an entry barrier for many schools. We present a design of a coincidence-counting module that replaces the traditional method based on time-to-amplitude conversion and pulse-height analysis. Our module accepts inputs from up to four detectors, has a coincidence-time window of less than 10ns, and has a throughput of more than triple that of the traditional method. The cost of our coincidence-counting module is less than 5\\% of the cost of the traditional method.}",

    abstract = "{We describe a series of experiments used in a sophomore-level quantum physics course that are designed to provide students with a hands-on introduction to quantum mechanics. By measuring correlations, we demonstrate that a helium-neon laser produces results consistent with a classical model of light. We then demonstrate that a light source derived from a spontaneous parametric down-conversion process produces results that can only be described using a quantum theory of light, thus providing a (nearly) single-photon source. These single photons are then sent into a Machâ€“Zehnder interferometer, and interference fringes are observed whenever the path of the photons cannot be determined. These experiments are investigated theoretically using straightforward quantum-mechanical calculations.}",
