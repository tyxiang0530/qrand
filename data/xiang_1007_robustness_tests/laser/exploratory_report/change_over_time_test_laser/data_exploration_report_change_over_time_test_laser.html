            <h1>Photon Statistics for Randomness Trial: Laser Robustness Tests</h1>
            <p>This report covers basic statistics on photon arrival times,                                photon counts, and coincidences. The settings used for this trial are: {'clock rate (hz)': 800.0, 'sample integration time (s)': 0.00125}. The following report was generated at: 20221011-202823</p>
